        <h1>Principles of clear and effective UI messages</h1>
        <h2>Why having voice and tone guidelines is important?</h2>
        <p>Voice and tone guidelines ensure that a company communicates consistently, effectively, and in a way that aligns with its brand identity. Creating a voice and tone guide helps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Maintain a uniform brand voice across websites, apps, emails, and social media, making the company’s messaging recognizable.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Present the company’s personality, values, and mission, helping it stand out from competitors.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Provide a better user experience by using the right tone for different situations.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>A friendly tone for casual interactions.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>An empathetic tone for error messages.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>A professional for formal communication.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Build credibility and emotional connection, making users more likely to engage and stay loyal to the brand.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Serve as a good reference for writers, marketers, and customer support teams, reducing guesswork and ensuring everyone communicates in a way that aligns with the brand.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some companies make their UX guides publicly available, for example:</p>

        <p>All the above companies emphasize the importance of connecting with their customers and talking to them in a way that resonates with them. Companies believe that the right voice makes people feel more comfortable and builds a connection with the company.</p>
        <h2>How is voice different from tone?</h2>
        <p>Both voice and tone shape how a company communicates, but they serve different purposes.</p>
        <p><strong>Voice</strong> is the company’s identity. It reflects the brand’s values, mission, and personality. It should remain consistent across all content.</p>
        <p><em>Examples:</em>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>A playful brand might always use a friendly, lighthearted voice.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A financial institution might have a professional, trustworthy voice.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Tone</strong> expresses the mood or feeling, which should change based on the audience and the situation.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p> A brand with a friendly voice might adjust its tone like this:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Success Message: "You did it! Your payment was successful." (Exciting)</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Error Message: "Oops! Something went wrong. Try again or contact support." (Calm)</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Security Alert: "We noticed an unusual login attempt. If this wasn’t you, reset your password immediately." (Serious)</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
