        <h1>Conciseness</h1>
        <p>Conciseness in writing UI messages means delivering essential information efficiently and effectively. Users interact with interfaces to complete tasks quickly, so UI messages need to be short, clear, and easy to scan. Additionally, technical constraints, like strict character limits, often require writers to be inventive with language and grammar while still maintaining clarity and usability.</p>
        <h2>Why conciseness matters</h2>
        <p>Concise UI messages help to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Enhance usability</strong> – short, clear messages help users navigate interfaces with minimal effort.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Reduce cognitive load</strong> – less text means less mental processing, making it easier for users to absorb key information.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Speed up decision-making</strong> – users can quickly understand what to do next without unnecessary distractions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Improve accessibility</strong> – concise text benefits users with cognitive disabilities or those reading on small screens.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How to write concisely</h2>
        <p>Concise UX writing leads to a smoother, faster, and more intuitive user experience. Key recommendations for concise UI messages are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Use as few words as possible. Avoid unnecessary and redundant information.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Focus on user goals and make sure that you create content for an actual use case.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Avoid long, complex sentences.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Remove filler words (“basically,” “very,” “absolutely”).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Avoid redundancy (avoid “help and support”, use “help” or “support” instead).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
