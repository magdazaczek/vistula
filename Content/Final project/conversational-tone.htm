        <h1>Conversational tone</h1>
        <p>A conversational tone in UX writing makes interactions feel natural, approachable, and human. A good tip is to avoid writing something we shouldn’t say out loud. We don’t want users to feel alienated or threatened. We want users to feel like the product can take care of them just as well as a helpful customer service rep would.</p>
        <h2>Why conversational tone matters</h2>
        <p>Conversational UI messages help to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Build trust</strong> – when an interface sounds human, users feel more comfortable and confident.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Enhance clarity</strong> – natural language is easier to understand than robotic or overly technical wording.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Create engagement</strong> – users are more likely to respond to a friendly, conversational message.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Reduce frustration</strong> – a warm, empathetic tone reassures users and makes errors feel less intimidating.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How to write conversational messages</h2>
        <p>If you want to improve UI messages to be more conversation, apply these rules:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Use active voice rather than passive voice - for example, instead of writing “Please select the preferred payment method.”, write “How would you like to pay?”.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Just say it, imagine the user is standing right in front of you, how would you tell them that? Try to be as natural and spontaneous as you can, without processing or structuring beforehand.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Read it out loud to make sure that your UI messages sound as if a real human said them.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Speak directly to the user.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
