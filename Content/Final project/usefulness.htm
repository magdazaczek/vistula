        <h1>Usefulness</h1>
        <p>Useful UI messages ensure that users receive clear, actionable guidance, helping them continue their journey within a product. A useful message explains the current status, provides clear instructions, and suggests appropriate actions to take.</p>
        <h2>Why usefulness matters</h2>
        <p>Useful UI messages help to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Keep users engaged</strong> – helpful messages prevent frustration and keep users within the product or website.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Enhance clarity and security</strong> – users feel more confident when they understand what happened and what to do next.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Encourage action</strong> – well-written messages guide users toward the next step instead of leaving them stranded.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Create a positive experience</strong> – a supportive and instructional tone reassures users and makes interactions feel effortless.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How to write usefully</h2>
        <p>To write useful UI messages, it’s worth applying the following rules:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Explain the current situation and clearly state what happened.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Provide specific instructions and don’t forget to tell users what to do next.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Avoid overwhelming users with too many options.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Use a positive, reassuring tone to reduce frustration and encourage action.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Offer solutions. For example, suggest alternatives like links to other pages or ways to correct mistakes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Keep it actionable and clear to ensure that users can quickly understand.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
