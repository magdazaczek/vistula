        <h1>Clarity</h1>
        <p>Clarity in the context of writing UI messages means making the content easy to understand and free from ambiguity. The goal is to ensure that users, not just designers or developers, can quickly understand what’s happening and what action they need to take.</p>
        <h2>Why clarity matters</h2>
        <p>Clear UI messages help to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Prevent confusion</strong> – clear writing removes technical jargon and vague language that could mislead users.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Enhance accessibility</strong> – simple, direct wording ensures that all users, regardless of technical knowledge, can navigate a product easily.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Improve user experience</strong> – users feel more confident and in control when instructions and messages are straightforward.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Boost engagemen</strong>t – clearer calls to action increase interaction.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How to write clearly</h2>
        <p>By focusing on clarity, UX writers create a smoother, more intuitive experience for users, reducing frustration and enhancing usability. One effective method is to apply principles from <a href="https://www.asd-ste100.org/">Simplified Technical English (STE)</a>. STE is a controlled language developed to reduce ambiguity and improve comprehension, especially in technical communication. It was developed to make technical documents easier to understand for people with very little English. By adopting STE guidelines, UX writers can ensure their messages are easy to understand for a global audience. Key recommendations for clear UI messages are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Use simple sentence structures and short sentences.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Avoid technical jargon unless necessary, and explain terms when used.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Avoid ambiguity by using clear, action-oriented button labels.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Be cautious with humor and metaphors, as not all users will understand them.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Prioritize user needs over internal terminology and ensure the message is relevant.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
